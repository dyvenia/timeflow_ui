## CSS Build

First, install all the necessary node modules:

`npm install`

Then, run the css file build. This will create a css asset `build/_tailwind.css`.

`npm run build`


## IDOM

To run the sample app, do:

`python sample_app.py`

To run in watch mode do:

`python run_sample_app.py`

Please node the watch mode is a bit clunky, you will need to change a file after running the first command to make it work. This is a bug.
